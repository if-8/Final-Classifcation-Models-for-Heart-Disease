# Final-Classifcation-Models-for-Heart-Disease
This project analyzes factors that may predict heart disease in a sample dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Building logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, AdaBoost, support vector machine, and voting classification models, I examine the accuracy of these models in diagnosing heart disease.
